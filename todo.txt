add  lp check
fix telegram messages - completed
fix buy bot using jupiter api -completed
create a hash of the json file to quickly check if it's been updates which will speed up polling
place candidates in a buffer and add more if the website is added and matches the confluence -competed
check how often the jupiter file is updated as it may take some time for the token to appear on jupiter (important)
tokens seem to be updates in baths every 20-30 min on jupiter which is a little slow but can still let us buy early
check metadata further using solscan api
add wallet balance checker to check if its able to purchase another token


what i noticed is that jupiter has a lag with adding logo uri so when a token doesn't have a logo uri (do not add it to the list of visited tokens as those tokens could be moon coins(URGENT)


might delete the token file or re design the code as no matter if the token was a mooner or not we dont want to trigger the bot for this token if it was already released ( might still keep the file for the list of pas mooners for back testing )


readng the jupiter api website initally is fine but inside the loop im not sure yet(important)

break even after it goes above 120% from entry

check for liquidy pairs (orca)
